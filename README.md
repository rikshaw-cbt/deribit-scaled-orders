# deribit-scaled-orders
Chrome / Firefox extension for making scaled orders on Deribit

Original author: https://twitter.com/cipher_science

Note:

Old version did not set order amounts in quantities of $10. This one rounds each amount to a multiple of $10.

The rounding may result in the total order quantity being slightly larger than what you entered.
